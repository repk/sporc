TODO list not sorted:

- Add trap implementations
- Add remaining instructions
- Initialize registers correctly (It seems that only PSR's ET and S bits init
  are mandatory as well as a ASI of 9)
- Add configurable number of window
- Support for ASI
- Support for some IO (e.g. UART, ...)
- Support for privileged/unprivileged instructions
- Trap on unimplemented instruction
- Support Error Mode
- Support Y and ASR registers
